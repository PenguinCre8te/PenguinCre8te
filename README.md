# Welcome!

Hi there! I'm a very random developer who loves to mess around with anything code-related. Whether it's building [my own programming language](https://github.com/PenguinCre8te/Penguinlang) with nothing special (doesn't even have a function call stack yet which means no io) or reverse-engineering a landline telephone (don't ask and it failed), I'm always up for a challenge.

## What I Mess With
- Frontend chaos (I hate frontenddd): HTML (bad at it), CSS, JavaScript, react native (trying)
- Backend experiments: Python, Node.js (also trying)
- Random tech: Arduino, AI models (just pulling with ollama, made sth with scikit-learn tho), CLI tools
- Low level stuff: C and C++, rust(trying)
- Games: Godot
- Whatever catches my eye next...

## Current Mood
> “Segmentation fault: Core dumped”

## Featured Projects
- None. Everything is terrible. I'd appreciate it if you go check it out tho.

## How to Reach Me
- Just don't?
- or ... yeah just don't
- nvm my email cleverpenguinmail@gmail.com
